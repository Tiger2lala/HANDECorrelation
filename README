# Correlation estimator for HANDE calculations

This code is an implementation of using the (statistical) correlation in the coupled cluster Monte Carlo calculations (with [HANDE](https://github.com/hande-qmc/hande)) to reduce the stochastic error in projected energies.

At the moment, this can only work for small systems where FCI can be performed. Comparing the results with standard analysis methods is highly recommended.
